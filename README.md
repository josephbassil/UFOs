# UFOs

1- We downloaded the JavaScript file (data.js) containing all the data needed to populate our HTML table
2- We created app.js (in VS code) in our repo folder where we'll write the code that builds the HTML (web) table and fills it with our data (data.js)
3- We created our index.html file where everything will be displayed, created our style.css and organized our UFOs file

Next Step is mapping what we're going to do on a storyboard
